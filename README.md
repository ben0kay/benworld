# Benworld

**Repository:** ben0kay/benworld  
**Engine:** Godot 4 .NET / C# (planned)  
**Status:** Planning / repository foundation — no gameplay or world systems are implemented yet.

## Vision

Benworld is a clean, modular foundation for experimenting with a first-person, simulation-focused game in a large, natural, procedurally generated world. The first technical priority is a **custom Godot terrain generator**—not an installed terrain plugin—exploring 3D density fields, marching cubes, chunk streaming, distance-based level of detail (LOD), and background generation. The long-term game may involve wilderness exploration, scavenging, enterable buildings, basements, caves, survival systems, and AI; those are directions, **not commitments or implemented features**.

The project deliberately separates **world technology** from **FPS gameplay** so either can be developed and tested without the other. Existing work from War Machine and Final Machine is a reference library; copy over individual proven components only when specifically approved and compatible.

## Core development approach: independent scenes

Build each subsystem in its own scene and test environment; bring them together later through **scene instancing and shared contracts**, not by merging unrelated source code or making one monolithic test scene.

| Development scene | Primary purpose | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Scenes/Tests/FPS_Test.tscn** | Player movement, camera, controls, inventory, weapons, interaction, stamina | Player scene and minimal graybox collision |
| **Scenes/Tests/World_Test.tscn** | Marching cubes, terrain topology, caves, chunks, LOD, streaming, vegetation, performance | World scene and independent free-fly/debug camera |
| **Scenes/Tests/Buildings_Test.tscn** | Buildings, interiors, doors, props, stairs, basements, collision | Building scenes and test ground |
| **Scenes/Tests/AI_Test.tscn** | Pathfinding, perception, investigation, combat and NPC simulation | AI actors, simple target/player stand-in, test geometry |
| **Scenes/Game/MainGame.tscn** | Eventually instantiate integrated World, Player, AI and UI | Only systems ready for integration |

Each test scene should launch on its own. The World scene must not require a fully implemented Player scene; the Player must not assume the presence of a particular terrain. Provide small adapters (spawn placement, terrain collision, world queries, interaction, persistence) when integrating.

## Planned project layout

The paths below are the **target structure**, not a claim that the files already exist. Create feature folders/scenes as each phase actually needs them; do not commit empty placeholders just to match the diagram.

Prefer one clearly owned folder per subsystem, reusable sub-scenes, configuration resources for tunable values, and a brief feature README when a subsystem becomes real. Keep scene and script names stable once used by other systems.

These are **ownership concepts**, not nodes that must be created on day one. Keep streaming, persistent actors/props, vegetation, terrain and shared services distinct. Systems should be configurable through exports and resources rather than hard-coded test-scene node paths.

## Custom procedural world — technical direction

### 1. Density-based geometry and marching cubes

- Use deterministic world-space noise and an editable **3D signed density function** to classify solid versus empty space.
- Marching cubes samples the eight corners of each cell; when density changes sign, interpolate edge positions and emit triangles. Adjacent chunks must sample matching border coordinates.
- Begin with surface hills, then test caves, overhangs, cliffs and underground volumes. The generation algorithm alone does not provide attractive terrain: separate density shaping, biome rules, materials and vegetation.
- Do not automatically assume marching cubes is the cheapest approach everywhere. Evaluate **hybrid heightfield surface + volumetric cave regions** if measurements show it is advantageous.

### 2. Chunk layout and quadtree/LOD

- Proposed first experiment: **32 m chunk width**, with **32 × 32 × 32 m** volumetric chunks when needed; at 1 m spacing a complete voxel cell chunk needs **33 samples per axis** for shared boundaries.
- These are **starting settings**, not permanent constraints. Chunk coordinates and density sampling must be deterministic and world-space-based.
- Use horizontal region management (a quadtree is a candidate) for surface visibility/LOD and 3D chunk indexing for underground volumes. Compare an octree only if justified.
- Implement explicit LOD transition handling, skirt/transvoxel-style stitching or another validated crack-prevention method. Coarse/fine neighbour transitions require their own solution.
- Keep terrain mesh LOD, collision residency, vegetation LOD, building/object streaming and AI simulation as separate concerns.

### 3. Multithreading and streaming

- Generate density buffers, meshes and placement data on background workers when safe.
- Integrate scene-tree nodes and resources on the appropriate Godot thread; avoid unsafe worker access to active scene nodes.
- Use generation queues, cancellation/stale-result rejection, bounded worker budgets and unload rules so movement does not cause memory or CPU spikes.
- Stream the **area around the player**; never allocate a complete 32 km volumetric grid. Persist only seeds/settings and player-authored changes where possible.

### 4. World scale, persistence and rendering

- **Initial proof of concept:** approximately **512 × 512 m**, expandable after a stable chunked prototype.
- **Long-term ambition:** up to **32 km × 32 km**, subject to performance and actual game needs; not a guaranteed milestone.
- Plan for large-world coordinate precision early (for example, floating origin or a suitable large-world build strategy), but implement only when needed.
- Use suitable materials, terrain blending, fog, natural lighting, MultiMesh vegetation instancing and authored tree/grass LODs. The marching-cubes algorithm itself does **not** generate lush visuals.
- Keep generated terrain reproducible by seed. Save terrain edits, structures and persistent actors separately, with a versioned format.

### Recommended first implementation

Start with **BW-00** and **BW-W1**. Make World_Test independently playable with an orbit/free-fly camera. Verify generated mesh, surface normals and collision before adding vegetation or 32 km scale. Build FPS_Test in parallel as a basic graybox, **not** entangled with World_Test.

Advance to later milestones only after the previous implementation is reviewed. A Git commit or a compiling project is not proof of acceptable visual quality, correct caves or smooth FPS.

## Architecture and integration contracts

- **World owns terrain**: generation, mesh/collision residency, world seed, biomes and world queries such as surface height, solid/empty samples and safe spawn positions.
- **Player owns FPS behavior**: movement, camera, input, equipment and interactions. It should consume world information via explicit contracts, not by knowing the test level hierarchy.
- **Buildings own their geometry**: authored/procedural structure, interiors, colliders, interactable objects and optional requests for terrain excavation/placement. World integration resolves those requests.
- **AI owns its behavior**: perception, navigation and actions; level geometry and spawn handling come from its host scene.
- **MainGame composes subsystems**: instances the scenes and connects interfaces/signals. Avoid direct hard-coded cross-feature node paths.
- **Saving** stores world seed, generated-world version, terrain modifications, actors and objects separately. Distinguish deterministic content from mutable state.

## Performance and validation principles

Aim for **smooth FPS without stalling when crossing chunk boundaries**, but benchmark actual frame time, memory and chunk-generation latency rather than declaring an arbitrary FPS guarantee.

- Prefer jobs/events over idle per-frame loops; bound worker queues and mesh upload work.
- Avoid per-blade grass nodes, unnecessary collisions on distant geometry, and high-detail volumetric data outside the active region.
- Test cracks at both same-resolution and differing-LOD borders, cave normals, seams, collider readiness, teleport/fast traversal, unloading and re-entry.
- Maintain a debug view of active chunks, queued jobs, LOD levels, generation timings and rough memory use.
- Keep checks focused; owner performs visual/FPS checks in Godot. Report clearly what was and wasn't verified.

## Reuse from existing repositories

- **[War Machine](https://github.com/ben0kay/war-machine):** FPS/player systems, interactions, buildings/props, AI experiments, chunk streaming patterns, root ownership, and development lessons.
- **[Final Machine](https://github.com/ben0kay/final-machine):** vegetation assets and LODs, graphics/forest authoring lessons, scene/configuration conventions, and the source of the initial agent/code-preference documents.
- **[Terra Machine](https://github.com/ben0kay/terra-machine):** additional foliage, performance and world-art experiments.

**Do not port Terrain3D or Voxel Tools implementations automatically.** Transfer isolated assets or reusable logic only after examining dependencies, licensing, coordinate systems, and compatibility with Benworld's custom generator. Assets/code have **not** been copied into this repository as part of these planning documents.

## Instructions for future contributors and AI agents

Read **AGENTS.md**, **CodePreferences.md**, this README, and the owning feature documents before making changes. Respect the planned-versus-implemented distinction, feature ownership, minimal testing policy, and project branch permissions. Propose focused steps, avoid unrelated rewrites, and keep project plans updated as milestones become real.
